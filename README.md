# Cyu tool kit

I have developed a variety of tools myself, including:

- **click-copy block**: Simply click on the designated text, and it will be immediately copied to your clipboard, eliminating the need for manual selection and copying.

## How to install
Go to Community Plugins in your Obsidian Settings and disable Safe Mode
Click on Browse and search for "Obsidian Charts"
Click install
Toggle the Plugin on in the Community Plugins Tab
